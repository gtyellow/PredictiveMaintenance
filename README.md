# PredictiveMaintenance
Use artificial intelligence for predictive maintenance

# This code takes a dataset of machine and tries to model a predictive maintenance schedule
# The goal is to keep the equipment in service for as long as possible while avoiding equipment failure before maintenance must be performed or equipment replaced
# This appears to be a classification problem to predict when there will be a failure.  
# The model will be structured such that you can feed a production schedule into the model and estimate a failure.
